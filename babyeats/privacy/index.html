    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Baby Eats &mdash; Effective February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>GFAM Labs ("we", "our", "us") built Baby Eats as a commercial application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect any personal information.</strong> Baby Eats does not transmit any data from your device to our servers or any third party. The app makes no network requests for its core functionality.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device using standard iOS preferences (UserDefaults). This data never leaves your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your baby's birth date (used to calculate age-appropriate recommendations)</li>
      <li>Feeding approach preference (Baby-Led Weaning, Pur&eacute;e, or Mixed)</li>
      <li>Allergen exclusion preferences (top 9 allergens)</li>
      <li>Food history and recommendations viewed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can reset all stored data by deleting and reinstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Baby Eats offers an optional one-time in-app purchase ($4.99) processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Purchase transactions are handled entirely by Apple in accordance with their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks.</strong> We do not collect usage data, crash reports, device identifiers, or any other telemetry. The app contains no third-party SDKs.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Baby Eats does not integrate with any third-party services. The only network activity is Apple's StoreKit framework processing the optional in-app purchase.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Baby Eats is designed for use by parents and caregivers, not by children directly. The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we collect no personal information from any user, there is no risk of children's data being collected.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@gfamlabs.com">support@gfamlabs.com</a>.</p>
