    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <p class="meta">Baby Eats &mdash; Effective February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>By downloading or using Baby Eats ("the App"), you agree to these Terms of Use. If you do not agree, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>Use of the App</h2>
    <p>Baby Eats provides daily food recommendations for infants aged 4-18 months. The App is intended for use by parents and caregivers as a reference tool to support the introduction of solid foods.</p>

    <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>Baby Eats is not a substitute for professional medical advice.</strong> The food recommendations provided by this App are for informational and reference purposes only. They do not constitute medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. When introducing solid foods to your baby:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Always consult your pediatrician</strong> before starting solid foods and before introducing new foods, especially common allergens.</li>
      <li><strong>Every baby is different.</strong> Your pediatrician knows your baby's specific health needs, developmental readiness, and medical history.</li>
      <li><strong>Watch for allergic reactions.</strong> Introduce new foods one at a time and monitor your baby for any adverse reactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Follow your pediatrician's guidance</strong> over any recommendation provided by this App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Allergen Disclaimer</h2>
    <p><strong>The allergen exclusion feature is a convenience tool, not a safety guarantee.</strong> While Baby Eats filters recommendations based on your selected allergen exclusions (top 9 allergens: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, soy, fish, shellfish, sesame), you should be aware that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Allergen filtering is based on primary ingredients and may not account for all possible cross-contamination risks.</li>
      <li>Food preparation methods and specific products may introduce allergens not reflected in the App's recommendations.</li>
      <li>GFAM Labs is not responsible for adverse allergic reactions. Always verify ingredients independently and consult your pediatrician regarding allergen introduction.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, GFAM Labs shall not be liable for any injury, illness, allergic reaction, or other adverse outcome arising from the use of food recommendations provided in the App. You use all recommendations at your own risk and assume full responsibility for your baby's feeding decisions.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Baby Eats offers an optional one-time in-app purchase ($4.99) to unlock premium features ("This Week" view and Quick Lookup). All purchases are processed by Apple and are subject to Apple's <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/dev/stdeula/" target="_blank">Standard End User License Agreement</a>. Purchases are non-consumable and can be restored on any device signed into the same Apple ID.</p>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content in Baby Eats — including food recommendations, preparation instructions, text, design, and graphics — is owned by GFAM Labs and protected by applicable intellectual property laws.</p>

    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the United States. Any disputes shall be resolved in accordance with applicable law.</p>
