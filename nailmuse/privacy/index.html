    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">NailMuse &mdash; Effective February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>GFAM Labs ("we", "our", "us") built NailMuse as a commercial application. This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>NailMuse collects and processes the following information to provide its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Text prompts:</strong> When you describe your desired nail art design, your text prompt is sent to the OpenAI API to generate images. These prompts are transmitted over an encrypted connection and are processed by OpenAI in accordance with their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or have access to your text prompts on our servers.</strong> Prompts are sent directly from the app to the OpenAI API for image generation and are not retained by GFAM Labs.</p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and never transmitted to GFAM Labs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generated nail art images saved to your favorites</li>
      <li>Skin tone and nail shape preferences</li>
      <li>App settings and preferences</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can reset all stored data by deleting and reinstalling the app.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>NailMuse uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenAI API:</strong> Your text prompts are sent to OpenAI's image generation service to create nail art designs. OpenAI processes this data according to their <a href="https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies" target="_blank">API Data Usage Policies</a>. GFAM Labs uses the OpenAI API in a configuration where prompts and outputs are not used to train OpenAI's models.</li>
      <li><strong>Apple StoreKit:</strong> Subscription purchases are processed by Apple through the App Store. We do not have access to your payment information. Transactions are handled by Apple in accordance with their <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>NailMuse offers a subscription ($9.99/year with a 7-day free trial) managed entirely by Apple. We do not collect or store any billing or payment information. Subscription status is verified through Apple's StoreKit framework.</p>

    <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not use any analytics, tracking, or advertising frameworks.</strong> We do not collect usage data, crash reports, device identifiers, or any other telemetry beyond what Apple provides to all developers through App Store Connect (anonymous, aggregated metrics).</p>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>NailMuse does not require an account and does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or location. No user profiles are created.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>NailMuse does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require age verification as it does not collect personal information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@gfamlabs.com">support@gfamlabs.com</a>.</p>
